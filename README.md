# Welcome to Basic Image Analysis with scikit-image

This workshop covers the basics of image analysis using scikit-image (`skimage`), a popular image analysis toolkit written in Python. It is geared toward those with low-to-moderate programming experience, but beginners should be able to follow along with the provided tutorial code. This material will cover image file IO, basic processing such as rescaling and filtering, and basic image segmentation.
